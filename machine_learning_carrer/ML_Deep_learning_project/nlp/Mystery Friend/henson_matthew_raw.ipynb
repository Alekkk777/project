    "When the news of the discovery of the North Pole, by Commander Peary,\n",
    "was first sent to the world, a distinguished citizen of New York City,\n",
    "well versed in the affairs of the Peary Arctic Club, made the statement,\n",
    "that he was sure that Matt Henson had been with Commander Peary on the\n",
    "day of the discovery. \n",
    "\n",
    "There were not many people who knew who Henson\n",
    "was, or the reason why the gentleman had made the remark, and, when\n",
    "asked why he was so certain, he explained that, for the best part of the\n",
    "twenty years of Commander Peary's Arctic work, his faithful and often\n",
    "only companion was Matthew Alexander Henson.\n",
    "\n",
    "To-day there is a more general knowledge of Commander Peary, his work\n",
    "and his success, and a vague understanding of the fact that Commander\n",
    "Peary's sole companion from the realm of civilization, when he stood at\n",
    "the North Pole, was Matthew A. Henson, a Colored Man.\n",
    "\n",
    "To satisfy the demand of perfectly natural curiosity, I have undertaken\n",
    "to write a brief autobiography, giving particularly an account of my\n",
    "Arctic work.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was born in Charles County, Maryland, August 8, 1866. \n",
    "The place of my birth was on the Potomac River, about forty-four miles below Washington,\n",
    "D. C. Slavery days were over forever when I was born. Besides, my\n",
    "parents were both free born before me, and in my mother's veins ran some\n",
    "white blood. At an early age, my parents were induced to leave the\n",
    "country and remove to Washington, D. C. My mother died when I was seven\n",
    "years old. I was taken in charge by my uncle, who sent me to school, the\n",
    "\"N Street School\" in Washington, D. C., which I attended for over six\n",
    "years. After leaving school I went to Baltimore, Md., where I shipped as\n",
    "cabin-boy, on board a vessel bound for China. After my first voyage I\n",
    "became an able-bodied seaman, and for four years followed the sea in\n",
    "that capacity, sailing to China, Japan, Manilla, North Africa, Spain,\n",
    "France, and through the Black Sea to Southern Russia.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was while I was in Washington, D. C., in 1888, that I first attracted\n",
    "the attention of Commander Peary, who at that time was a civil engineer\n",
    "in the United States Navy, with the rank of lieutenant, and it was with\n",
    "the instinct of my race that I recognized in him the qualities that made\n",
    "me willing to engage myself in his service. I accompanied him as his\n",
    "body-servant to Nicaragua. I was his messenger at the League Island Navy\n",
    "Yard, and from the beginning of his second expedition to the Arctic\n",
    "regions, in 1891, I have been a member of every expedition of his, in\n",
    "the capacity of assistant: a term that covers a multitude of duties,\n",
    "abilities, and responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The narrative that follows is a record of the last and successful\n",
    "expedition of the Peary Arctic Club, which had as its attainment the\n",
    "discovery of the North Pole, and is compiled from notes made by me at\n",
    "different times during the course of the expedition. I did endeavor to\n",
    "keep a diary or journal of daily events during my last trip, and did not\n",
    "find it difficult aboard the ship while sailing north, or when in\n",
    "winter-quarters at Cape Sheridan, but I found it impossible to make\n",
    "daily entries while in the field, on account of the constant necessity\n",
    "of concentrating my attention on the real business of the expedition.\n",
    "Entries were made daily of the records of temperature and the estimates\n",
    "of distance traveled; and when solar observations were made the results\n",
    "were always carefully noted. There were opportunities to complete the\n",
    "brief entries on several occasions while out on the ice, notably the six\n",
    "days' enforced delay at the \"Big Lead,\" 84 north, the twelve hours\n",
    "preceding the return of Captain Bartlett at 87 47' north, and the\n",
    "thirty-three hours at North Pole, while Commander Peary was determining\n",
    "to a certainty his position. During the return from the Pole to Cape\n",
    "Columbia, we were so urged by the knowledge of the supreme necessity of\n",
    "speed that the thought of recording the events of that part of the\n",
    "journey did not occur to me so forcibly as to compel me to pay heed to\n",
    "it, and that story was written aboard the ship while waiting for\n",
    "favorable conditions to sail toward home lands.\n",
    "\n",
    "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
    "\n",
    "It was in June, 1891, that I started on my first trip to the Arctic\n",
    "regions, as a member of what was known as the \"North Greenland\n",
    "Expedition.\" Mrs. Peary accompanied her husband, and among the members\n",
    "of the expedition were Dr. Frederick A. Cook, of Brooklyn, N. Y., Mr.\n",
    "Langdon Gibson, of Flushing, N. Y., and Mr. Eivind Astrp, of\n",
    "Christiania, Norway, who had the honor of being the companion of\n",
    "Commander Peary in the first crossing of North Greenland--and of having\n",
    "an Esquimo at Cape York become so fond of him that he named his son for\n",
    "him! It was on this voyage north that Peary's leg was broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. John M. Verhoeff, a stalwart young Kentuckian, was also an\n",
    "enthusiastic member of the party. When the expedition was ready to sail\n",
    "home the following summer, he lost his life by falling in a crevasse in\n",
    "a glacier. His body was never recovered. On the first and the last of\n",
    "Peary's expeditions, success was marred by tragedy. On the last\n",
    "expedition, Professor Ross G. Marvin, of Cornell University, lost his\n",
    "life by being drowned in the Arctic Ocean, on his return from his\n",
    "farthest north, a farther north than had ever been made by any other\n",
    "explorers except the members of the last expedition. Both Verhoeff and\n",
    "Marvin were good friends of mine, and I respect and venerate their\n",
    "memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally the impressions formed on my first visit to the Land of Ice\n",
    "and Snow were the most lasting, but in the coming years I was to learn\n",
    "more and more that such a life was no picnic, and to realize what\n",
    "primitive life meant. I was to live with a people who, the scientists\n",
    "stated, represented the earliest form of human life, living in what is\n",
    "known as the Stone Age, and I was to revert to that stage of life by\n",
    "leaps and bounds, and to emerge from it by the same sudden means. Many\n",
    "and many a time, for periods covering more than twelve months, I have\n",
    "been to all intents an Esquimo, with Esquimos for companions, speaking\n",
    "their language, dressing in the same kind of clothes, living in the same\n",
    "kind of dens, eating the same food, enjoying their pleasures, and\n",
    "frequently sharing their griefs. I have come to love these people. I\n",
    "know every man, woman, and child in their tribe. They are my friends and\n",
    "they regard me as theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first return to civilization, I was to come back to the\n",
    "savage, ice- and rock-bound country seven times more. It was in June,\n",
    "1893, that I again sailed north with Commander Peary and his party on\n",
    "board the _Falcon_, a larger ship than the _Kite_, the one we sailed\n",
    "north in on the previous expedition, and with a much larger equipment,\n",
    "including several burros from Colorado, which were intended for ice-cap\n",
    "work, but which did not make good, making better dog-food instead.\n",
    "Indeed the dogs made life a burden for the poor brutes from the very\n",
    "start. Mrs. Peary was again a member of the expedition, as well as\n",
    "another woman, Mrs. Cross, who acted as Mrs. Peary's maid and nurse. It\n",
    "was on this trip that I adopted the orphan Esquimo boy, Kudlooktoo, his\n",
    "mother having died just previous to our arrival at the Red Cliffs.\n",
    "After this boy was washed and scrubbed by me, his long hair cut short,\n",
    "and his greasy, dirty clothes of skins and furs burned, a new suit made\n",
    "of odds and ends collected from different wardrobes on the ship made him\n",
    "a presentable Young American. I was proud of him, and he of me. He\n",
    "learned to speak English and slept underneath my bunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "This expedition was larger in numbers than the previous one, but the\n",
    "results, owing to the impossible weather conditions, were by no means\n",
    "successful, and the following season all of the expedition returned to\n",
    "the United States except Commander Peary, Hugh J. Lee, and myself. When\n",
    "the expedition returned, there were two who went back who had not come\n",
    "north with us. Miss Marie Ahnighito Peary, aged about ten months, who\n",
    "first saw the light of day at Anniversary Lodge on the 12th of the\n",
    "previous September, was taken by her mother to her kinfolks in the\n",
    "South. Mrs. Peary also took a young Esquimo girl, well known among us as\n",
    "\"Miss Bill,\" along with her, and kept her for nearly a year, when she\n",
    "gladly permitted her to return to Greenland and her own people. Miss\n",
    "Bill is now grown up, and has been married three times and widowed, not\n",
    "by death but by desertion. She is known as a \"Holy Terror.\" I do not\n",
    "know the reason why, but I have my suspicions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory of the winter of 1894 and 1895 and the summer following will\n",
    "never leave me. The events of the journey to 87 6' in 1906 and the\n",
    "discovery of the North Pole in 1909 are indelibly impressed on my mind,\n",
    "but the recollections of the long race with death across the 450 miles\n",
    "of the ice-cap of North Greenland in 1895, with Commander Peary and Hugh\n",
    "Lee, are still the most vivid.\n",
    "\n",
    "For weeks and weeks, across the seemingly never-ending wastes of the\n",
    "ice-cap of North Greenland, I marched with Peary and Lee from\n",
    "Independence Bay and the land beyond back to Anniversary Lodge. We\n",
    "started on April 1, 1895, with three sledges and thirty-seven dogs, with\n",
    "the object of determining to a certainty the northeastern terminus of\n",
    "Greenland. We reached the northern land beyond the ice-cap, but the\n",
    "condition of the country did not allow much exploration, and after\n",
    "killing a few musk-oxen we started on June 1 to make our return. We had\n",
    "one sledge and nine dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We reached Anniversary Lodge on June 25, with one dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Grim Destroyer had been our constant companion, and it was months\n",
    "before I fully recovered from the effects of that struggle. When I left\n",
    "for home and God's Country the following September, on board the good\n",
    "old _Kite_, it was with the strongest resolution to never again! no\n",
    "more! forever! leave my happy home in warmer lands.\n",
    "Nevertheless, the following summer I was again \"Northward Bound,\" with\n",
    "Commander Peary, to help him secure, and bring to New York, the three\n",
    "big meteorites that he and Lee had discovered during the winter of\n",
    "1894-1895.\n",
    "\n",
    "The meteorites known as \"The Woman\" and \"The Dog\" were secured with\n",
    "comparative ease, and the work of getting the large seventy-ton meteor,\n",
    "known as \"The Tent,\" into such a position as to insure our securing it\n",
    "the following summer, was done, so it was not strange that the following\n",
    "summer I was again in Greenland, but the meteorite was not brought away\n",
    "that season.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is well known that the chief characteristic of Commander Peary is\n",
    "persistency which, coupled with fortitude, is the secret of his success.\n",
    "The next summer, 1897, he was again at the island after his prize, and\n",
    "he got it this time and brought it safely to New York, where it now\n",
    "reposes in the \"American Museum of Natural History.\" As usual I was a\n",
    "member of the party, and my back still aches when I think of the hard\n",
    "work I did to help load that monster aboard the _Hope_.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was during this voyage that Commander Peary announced his\n",
    "determination to discover the North Pole, and the following years (from\n",
    "1898 to 1902) were spent in the Arctic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1900, the American record of Farthest North, held by Lockwood and\n",
    "Brainard, was equaled and exceeded; their cairn visited and their\n",
    "records removed. On April 21, 1902, a new American record of 84 17' was\n",
    "made by Commander Peary, further progress north being frustrated by a\n",
    "lack of provisions and by a lane of open water, more than a mile wide.\n",
    "This lead or lane of open water I have since become more familiarly\n",
    "acquainted with. We have called it many names, but it is popularly known\n",
    "as the \"Big Lead.\" Going north, meeting it can be depended upon. It is\n",
    "situated just a few miles north of the 84th parallel, and is believed to\n",
    "mark the continental shelf of the land masses in the Northern\n",
    "Hemisphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the four years from 1898 to 1902, which were continuously spent\n",
    "in the regions about North Greenland, we had every experience, except\n",
    "death, that had ever fallen to the lot of the explorers who had preceded\n",
    "us, and more than once we looked death squarely in the face. Besides, we\n",
    "had many experiences that earlier explorers did not meet. In January,\n",
    "1899, Commander Peary froze his feet so badly that all but one of his\n",
    "toes fell off.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the return home, in 1902, it was three years before Commander\n",
    "Peary made another attack on the Pole, but during those years he was not\n",
    "resting.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was preparing to launch his final and \"sincerely to be hoped\"\n",
    "successful expedition, and in July, 1905, in the newly built ship,\n",
    "_Roosevelt_, we were again \"Poleward-bound.\" The following September,\n",
    "the _Roosevelt_ reached Cape Sheridan, latitude 82 27' north, under her\n",
    "own steam, a record unequaled by any other vessel, sail or steam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early the next year, the negotiation of the Arctic Ocean was commenced,\n",
    "not as oceans usually are negotiated, but as this ocean must be, by men,\n",
    "sledges, and dogs. The field party consisted of twenty-six men, twenty\n",
    "sledges, and one hundred and thirty dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was an open winter and an early spring, very desirable conditions\n",
    "in some parts of the world, but very undesirable to us on the northern\n",
    "coast of Greenland. The ice-pack began disintegrating much too early\n",
    "that year to suit, but we pushed on, and had it not been for furious\n",
    "storms enforcing delays and losses of many precious days, the Pole would\n",
    "have been reached. As it was, Commander Peary and his party got to 87\n",
    "6' north, thereby breaking _all records_, and in spite of incredible\n",
    "hardships, hunger and cold, returned safely with all of the expedition,\n",
    "and on Christmas Eve the _Roosevelt_, after a most trying voyage,\n",
    "entered New York harbor, somewhat battered but still seaworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the fact that it was to be his last attempt, Commander Peary no\n",
    "sooner reached home than he announced his intention to return, this time\n",
    "to be the last, and this time to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a year intervened, and it was not until July 6, 1908, with the\n",
    "God-Speed and good wishes of President Roosevelt, that the good ship\n",
    "named in his honor set sail again. The narrative of that voyage, and the\n",
    "story of the discovery of the North Pole, follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ages of the wild, misgiving mystery of the North Pole are over,\n",
    "to-day, and forever it stands under the folds of Old Glory.\n",
    "\n",
    "July 6, 1908: We're off! For a year and a half I have waited for this\n",
    "order, and now we have cast off. The shouting and the tumult ceases, the\n",
    "din of whistles, bells, and throats dies out, and once again the long,\n",
    "slow surge of the ocean hits the good ship that we have embarked in. It\n",
    "was at one-thirty P. M. to-day that I saw the last hawse-line cast\n",
    "adrift, and felt the throb of the engines of our own ship. Chief\n",
    "Wardwell is on the job, and from now on it is due north.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oyster Bay, Long Island Sound: We are expecting President Roosevelt. The\n",
    "ship has been named in his honor and has already made one voyage towards\n",
    "the North Pole, farther north than any ship has ever made.\n",
    "\n",
    "July 7: At anchor, the soft wooded hills of Long Island give me a\n",
    "curious impression. I am waiting for the command to attack the savage\n",
    "ice- and rock-bound fortress of the North, and here instead we are at\n",
    "anchor in the neighborhood of sheep grazing in green fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sydney, N. S., July 17, 1908: All of the expedition are aboard and those\n",
    "going home have gone. Mrs. Peary and the children, Mr. Borup's father,\n",
    "and Mr. Harry Whitney, and some other guests were the last to leave the\n",
    "_Roosevelt_, and have given us a last good-by from the tug, which came\n",
    "alongside to take them off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good-by all. Every one is sending back a word to some one he has left\n",
    "behind, but I have said my good-bys a long time ago, and as I waved my\n",
    "hand in parting salutation to the little group on the deck of the tug,\n",
    "my thoughts were with my wife, and I hoped when she next heard of me it\n",
    "would be with feelings of joy and happiness, and that she would be glad\n",
    "she had permitted me to leave her for an absence that might never end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tenderfeet, as the Commander calls them, are the Doctor, Professor\n",
    "MacMillan, and young Mr. Borup. The Doctor is a fine-looking, big\n",
    "fellow, John W. Goodsell, and has a swarthy complexion and straight\n",
    "hair; on meeting me he told me that he was well acquainted with me by\n",
    "reputation, and hoped to know me more intimately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Donald B. MacMillan is a professor in a college in\n",
    "Massachusetts, near Worcester, and I am going to cultivate his\n",
    "acquaintance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. George Borup is the kid, only twenty-one years old but well set up\n",
    "for his age, always ready to laugh, and has thick, curly hair. I\n",
    "understand he is a record-breaker in athletics. He will need his\n",
    "athletic ability on this trip. I am making no judgments or comments on\n",
    "these fellows now. Wait; I have seen too many enthusiastic starters, and\n",
    "I am sorry to say some of them did not finish well.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the rest of the members of the expedition are the same as were on\n",
    "the first trip of the _Roosevelt_:--Commander Peary, Captain Bartlett,\n",
    "Professor Marvin, Chief Engineer Wardwell, Charley Percy the steward,\n",
    "and myself. The crew has been selected by Captain Bartlett, and are\n",
    "mostly strangers to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commander Peary is too well known for me to describe him at length;\n",
    "thick reddish hair turning gray; heavy, bushy eyebrows shading his\n",
    "\"sharpshooter's eyes\" of steel gray, and long mustache. His hair grows\n",
    "rapidly and, when on the march, a thick heavy beard quickly appears. He\n",
    "is six feet tall, very graceful, and well built, especially about the\n",
    "chest and shoulders; long arms, and legs slightly bowed. Since losing\n",
    "his toes, he walks with a peculiar slide-like stride. He has a voice\n",
    "clear and loud, and words never fail him.\n",
    "\n",
    "Captain Bartlett is about my height and weight. He has short, curly,\n",
    "light-brown hair and red cheeks; is slightly round-shouldered, due to\n",
    "the large shoulder-muscles caused by pulling the oars, and is as quick\n",
    "in his actions as a cat. His manner and conduct indicate that he has\n",
    "always been the leader of his crowd from boyhood up, and there is no man\n",
    "on this ship that he would be afraid to tackle. He is a young man\n",
    "(thirty-three years old) for a ship captain, but he knows his job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Marvin is a quiet, earnest person, and has had plenty of\n",
    "practical experience besides his splendid education. He is rapidly\n",
    "growing bald; his face is rather thin, and his neck is long. He has\n",
    "taken great interest in me and, being a teacher, has tried to teach me.\n",
    "Although I hope to perfect myself in navigation, my knowledge so far\n",
    "consists only of knot and splice seamanship, and I need to master the\n",
    "mathematical end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chief Engineer, Mr. Wardwell, is a fine-looking, ruddy-complexioned\n",
    "giant, with the most honest eyes I have ever looked into. His hair is\n",
    "thinning and is almost pure white, and I should judge him to be about\n",
    "forty-five years old. He has the greatest patience, and I have never\n",
    "seen him lose his temper or get rattled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charley Percy is Commander Peary's oldest hand, next to me. He is our\n",
    "steward, and sees to it that we are properly fed while aboard ship, and\n",
    "he certainly does see to it with credit to himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Sydney to Hawks Harbor, where we met the _Erik_, has been\n",
    "uneventful except for the odor of the _Erik_, which is loaded with\n",
    "whale-meat and can be smelled for miles. We passed St. Paul's Island and\n",
    "Cape St. George early in the day and through the Straits of Belle Isle\n",
    "to Hawks Harbor, where there is a whale-factory. From here we leave for\n",
    "Turnavik.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been racing with the _Erik_ all day, and have beaten her to this\n",
    "place. Captain Bartlett's father owns it, and we loaded a lot of boots\n",
    "and skins, which the Captain's father had ready for us. From here we\n",
    "sail to the Esquimo country of North Greenland, without a stop if\n",
    "possible, as the Commander has no intention of visiting any of the\n",
    "Danish settlements in South Greenland.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cape York is our next point, and the ship is sailing free. Aside from\n",
    "the excitement of the start, and the honor of receiving the personal\n",
    "visit of the President, and his words of encouragement and cheer, the\n",
    "trip so far has been uneventful; and I have busied myself in putting my\n",
    "cabin in order, and making myself useful in overhauling and stowing\n",
    "provisions in the afterhold.\n",
    "\n",
    "July 24: Still northward-bound, with the sea rolling and washing over\n",
    "the ship; and the _Erik_ in the distance seems to be getting her share\n",
    "of the wash. She is loaded heavily with fresh whale-meat, and is\n",
    "purposely keeping in leeward of us to spare us the discomfort of the\n",
    "odor.\n",
    "\n",
    "July 25 and 26: Busy with my carpenter's kit in the Commander's cabin\n",
    "and elsewhere. There has been heavy rain and seas, and we have dropped\n",
    "the _Erik_ completely. The _Roosevelt_ is going fine. We can see the\n",
    "Greenland coast plainly and to-day, the 29th, we raised and passed Disco\n",
    "Island. Icebergs on all sides. The light at midnight is almost as bright\n",
    "as early evening twilight in New York on the Fourth of July and the\n",
    "ice-blink of the interior ice-cap is quite plain. We have gone through\n",
    "Baffin's Bay with a rush and raised Duck Island about ten A. M. and\n",

    "remember distinctly the cairn the party built and the money they\n",
    "deposited in it. I wonder if it is still there? There is little use for\n",
    "money up here, and the place is seldom visited except by men from the\n",

    "in welcome, and as soon as the bow of the boat had grazed the little\n",
    "beach, willing hands helped to run her up on shore. These people are\n",
    "hospitable and helpful, and always willing, sometimes too willing. As an\n",
    "example, I will tell how, at a settlement farther north, we were going\n",
    "ashore in one of the whale-boats. Captain Bartlett was forward,\n",
    "astraddle of the bow with the boat-hook in his hands to fend off the\n",
    "blocks of ice, and knew perfectly well where he wanted to land, but the\n",
    "group of excited Esquimos were in his way and though he ordered them\n",
    "back, they continued running about and getting in his way. In a very\n",
    "short while the Captain lost patience and commenced to talk loudly and\n",
    "with excitement; immediately Sipsoo took up his language and parrot-like\n",
    "started to repeat the Captain's exact words: \"Get back there, get\n",

    "trading for skins, dogs, lines, and other things; and also\n",
    "walrus-hunting. I have been up to my neck in work, and have had small\n",

    "civilized clothing, that we would wear in midwinter in the States. In\n",
