    "venom of the world it aims to reconstruct.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal even remotely with all that is being said and done against\n",
    "Anarchism would necessitate the writing of a whole volume.  I shall\n",

    "shall attempt to elucidate what Anarchism really stands for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strange phenomenon of the opposition to Anarchism is that it\n",
    "brings to light the relation between so-called intelligence and\n",
    "ignorance.  And yet this is not so very strange when we consider the\n",
    "relativity of all things.  The ignorant mass has in its favor that it\n",
    "makes no pretense of knowledge or tolerance.  Acting, as it always\n",
    "does, by mere impulse, its reasons are like those of a child.\n",
    "\"Why?\"  \"Because.\"  Yet the opposition of the uneducated to Anarchism\n",
    "deserves the same consideration as that of the intelligent man.\n",
    "\n",
    "What, then, are the objections?  First, Anarchism is impractical,\n",
    "though a beautiful ideal.  Second, Anarchism stands for violence and\n",
    "destruction, hence it must be repudiated as vile and dangerous.\n",

    "A practical scheme, says Oscar Wilde, is either one already in\n",
    "existence, or a scheme that could be carried out under the existing\n",
    "conditions; but it is exactly the existing conditions that one\n",
    "objects to, and any scheme that could accept these conditions is\n",
    "wrong and foolish.  The true criterion of the practical, therefore,\n",
    "is not whether the latter can keep intact the wrong or foolish;\n",
    "rather is it whether the scheme has vitality enough to leave the\n",
    "stagnant waters of the old, and build, as well as sustain, new life.\n",
    "In the light of this conception, Anarchism is indeed practical.\n",
    "More than any other idea, it is helping to do away with the wrong and\n",

    "aware that Anarchism, whose roots, as it were, are part of nature's\n",
    "forces, destroys, not healthful tissue, but parasitic growths that\n",

    "any given idea, to examine into its origin and meaning, most people\n",
    "will either condemn it altogether, or rely on some superficial or\n",

    "between him and his surroundings, is not far to seek.  The primitive\n",
    "man, unable to understand his being, much less the unity of all life,\n",
    "felt himself absolutely dependent on blind, hidden forces ever ready\n",
    "to mock and taunt him.  Out of that attitude grew the religious\n",

    "THE POWERS ARE EVERYTHING.  Thus Jehovah would only endure man on\n",
    "condition of complete surrender.  Man can have all the glories of the\n",
    "earth, but he must not become conscious of himself.  The State,\n",

    "\"Property is robbery,\" said the great French Anarchist, Proudhon.\n",
    "Yes, but without risk and danger to the robber.  Monopolizing the\n",

    "birthright, and has turned him loose a pauper and an outcast.\n",
    "Property has not even the time-worn excuse that man does not create\n",
    "enough to satisfy all needs.  The A B C student of economics knows\n",
    "that the productivity of labor within the last few decades far\n",
    "exceeds normal demand a hundredfold.  But what are normal demands to\n",
    "an abnormal institution?  The only demand that property recognizes is\n",
    "its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means\n",
    "power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to\n",
    "enslave, to outrage, to degrade.  America is particularly boastful of\n",
    "her great power, her enormous national wealth.  Poor America, of what\n",
    "avail is all her wealth, if the individuals comprising the nation are\n",
    "wretchedly poor?  If they live in squalor, in filth, in crime, with\n",
    "hope and joy gone, a homeless, soilless army of human prey.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally conceded that unless the returns of any business\n",
    "venture exceed the cost, bankruptcy is inevitable.  But those engaged\n",
    "in the business of producing wealth have not yet learned even this\n",
    "simple lesson.  Every year the cost of production in human life is\n",
    "growing larger (50,000 killed, 100,000 wounded in America last year);\n",
    "the returns to the masses, who help to create wealth, are ever\n",
    "getting smaller.  Yet America continues to be blind to the inevitable\n",
    "bankruptcy of our business of production.  Nor is this the only crime\n",
    "of the latter.  Still more fatal is the crime of turning the producer\n",
    "into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than\n",
    "his master of steel and iron.  Man is being robbed not merely of the\n",
    "products of his labor, but of the power of free initiative, of\n",
    "originality, and the interest in, or desire for, the things he is\n",

    "\n",
    "Real wealth consists in things of utility and beauty, in things that\n",
    "help to create strong, beautiful bodies and surroundings inspiring to\n",
    "live in.  But if man is doomed to wind cotton around a spool, or dig\n",
    "coal, or build roads for thirty years of his life, there can be no\n",
    "talk of wealth.  What he gives to the world is only gray and hideous\n",
    "things, reflecting a dull and hideous existence,--too weak to live,\n",
    "too cowardly to die.  Strange to say, there are people who extol this\n",
    "deadening method of centralized production as the proudest\n",
    "achievement of our age.  They fail utterly to realize that if we are\n",
    "to continue in machine subserviency, our slavery is more complete\n",
    "than was our bondage to the King.  They do not want to know that\n",

    "health and beauty, of art and science, all these being impossible in\n",
    "a clock-like, mechanical atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anarchism cannot but repudiate such a method of production: its goal\n",
    "is the freest possible expression of all the latent powers of the\n",
    "individual.  Oscar Wilde defines a perfect personality as \"one who\n",
    "develops under perfect conditions, who is not wounded, maimed, or in\n",
    "danger.\"  A perfect personality, then, is only possible in a state of\n",
    "society where man is free to choose the mode of work, the conditions\n",
    "of work, and the freedom to work.  One to whom the making of a table,\n",
    "the building of a house, or the tilling of the soil, is what the\n",
    "painting is to the artist and the discovery to the scientist,--the\n",
    "result of inspiration, of intense longing, and deep interest in work\n",
    "as a creative force.  That being the ideal of Anarchism, its economic\n",
    "arrangements must consist of voluntary productive and distributive\n",
    "associations, gradually developing into free communism, as the best\n",
    "means of producing with the least waste of human energy.  Anarchism,\n",
    "however, also recognizes the right of the individual, or numbers of\n",
    "individuals, to arrange at all times for other forms of work, in\n",
    "harmony with their tastes and desires.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such free display of human energy being possible only under complete\n",
    "individual and social freedom, Anarchism directs its forces against\n",
    "the third and greatest foe of all social equality; namely, the State,\n",
    "organized authority, or statutory law,--the dominion of human\n",
    "conduct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as religion has fettered the human mind, and as property, or the\n",
    "monopoly of things, has subdued and stifled man's needs, so has the\n",
    "State enslaved his spirit, dictating every phase of conduct.  \"All\n",
    "government in essence,\" says Emerson, \"is tyranny.\"  It matters not\n",
    "whether it is government by divine right or majority rule.  In every\n",
    "instance its aim is the absolute subordination of the individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to the American government, the greatest American\n",
    "Anarchist, David Thoreau, said: \"Government, what is it but a\n",
    "tradition, though a recent one, endeavoring to transmit itself\n",
    "unimpaired to posterity, but each instance losing its integrity; it\n",
    "has not the vitality and force of a single living man.  Law never\n",
    "made man a whit more just; and by means of their respect for it, even\n",
    "the well disposed are daily made agents of injustice.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the keynote of government is injustice.  With the arrogance\n",
    "and self-sufficiency of the King who could do no wrong, governments\n",
    "ordain, judge, condemn, and punish the most insignificant offenses,\n",
    "while maintaining themselves by the greatest of all offenses, the\n",
    "annihilation of individual liberty.  Thus Ouida is right when she\n",
    "maintains that \"the State only aims at instilling those qualities in\n",
    "its public by which its demands are obeyed, and its exchequer is\n",
    "filled.  Its highest attainment is the reduction of mankind to\n",
    "clockwork.  In its atmosphere all those finer and more delicate\n",
    "liberties, which require treatment and spacious expansion, inevitably\n",
    "dry up and perish.  The State requires a taxpaying machine in which\n",
    "there is no hitch, an exchequer in which there is never a deficit,\n",
    "and a public, monotonous, obedient, colorless, spiritless, moving\n",
    "humbly like a flock of sheep along a straight high road between two\n",
    "walls.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet even a flock of sheep would resist the chicanery of the State, if\n",
    "it were not for the corruptive, tyrannical, and oppressive methods it\n",
    "employs to serve its purposes.  Therefore Bakunin repudiates the\n",
    "State as synonymous with the surrender of the liberty of the\n",
    "individual or small minorities,--the destruction of social\n",
    "relationship, the curtailment, or complete denial even, of life\n",
    "itself, for its own aggrandizement.  The State is the altar of\n",
    "political freedom and, like the religious altar, it is maintained for\n",
    "the purpose of human sacrifice.\n",

    "The average man with his self-sufficiency, his ridiculously superior\n",
    "airs of patronage towards the female sex, is an impossibility for\n",
    "woman as depicted in the CHARACTER STUDY by Laura Marholm.  Equally\n",
    "impossible for her is the man who can see in her nothing more than\n",
    "her mentality and her genius, and who fails to awaken her woman\n",
    "nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rich intellect and a fine soul are usually considered necessary\n",
    "attributes of a deep and beautiful personality.  In the case of the\n",
    "modern woman, these attributes serve as a hindrance to the complete\n",
    "assertion of her being.  For over a hundred years the old form of\n",
    "marriage, based on the Bible, \"till death doth part,\" has been\n",
    "denounced as an institution that stands for the sovereignty of the\n",
    "man over the woman, of her complete submission to his whims and\n",
    "commands, and absolute dependence on his name and support.  Time and\n",
    "again it has been conclusively proved that the old matrimonial\n",
    "relation restricted woman to the function of a man's servant and the\n",
    "bearer of his children.  And yet we find many emancipated women who\n",
    "prefer marriage, with all its deficiencies, to the narrowness of an\n",
    "unmarried life; narrow and unendurable because of the chains of moral\n",
    "and social prejudice that cramp and bind her nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The explanation of such inconsistency on the part of many advanced\n",
    "women is to be found in the fact that they never truly understood the\n",
    "meaning of emancipation.  They thought that all that was needed was\n",
    "independence from external tyrannies; the internal tyrants, far more\n",
    "harmful to life and growth--ethical and social conventions--were left\n",
    "to take care of themselves; and they have taken care of themselves.\n",
    "They seem to get along as beautifully in the heads and hearts of the\n",
    "most active exponents of woman's emancipation, as in the heads and\n",
    "hearts of our grandmothers.\n",

    "These internal tyrants, whether they be in the form of public opinion\n",

    "Education say?  All these busybodies, moral detectives, jailers of\n",
    "the human spirit, what will they say?  Until woman has learned to\n",
    "defy them all, to stand firmly on her own ground and to insist upon\n",
    "her own unrestricted freedom, to listen to the voice of her nature,\n",
    "whether it call for life's greatest treasure, love for a man, or her\n",
    "most glorious privilege, the right to give birth to a child, she\n",
    "cannot call herself emancipated.  How many emancipated women are\n",
    "brave enough to acknowledge that the voice of love is calling, wildly\n",
    "beating against their breasts, demanding to be heard, to be\n",
    "satisfied.\n",

    "The French writer, Jean Reibrach, in one of his novels, NEW BEAUTY,\n",
    "attempts to picture the ideal, beautiful, emancipated woman.  This\n",
    "ideal is embodied in a young girl, a physician.  She talks very\n",
    "cleverly and wisely of how to feed infants; she is kind, and\n",
    "administers medicines free to poor mothers.  She converses with a\n",
    "young man of her acquaintance about the sanitary conditions of the\n",
    "future, and how various bacilli and germs shall be exterminated by\n",
    "the use of stone walls and floors, and by the doing away with rugs\n",
    "and hangings.  She is, of course, very plainly and practically\n",
    "dressed, mostly in black.  The young man, who, at their first\n",
    "meeting, was overawed by the wisdom of his emancipated friend,\n",
    "gradually learns to understand her, and recognizes one fine day that\n",
    "he loves her.  They are young, and she is kind and beautiful, and\n",
    "though always in rigid attire, her appearance is softened by a\n",
    "spotlessly clean white collar and cuffs.  One would expect that he\n",
    "would tell her of his love, but he is not one to commit romantic\n",
    "absurdities.  Poetry and the enthusiasm of love cover their blushing\n",
    "faces before the pure beauty of the lady.  He silences the voice of\n",
    "his nature, and remains correct.  She, too, is always exact, always\n",
    "rational, always well behaved.  I fear if they had formed a union,\n",
    "the young man would have risked freezing to death.  I must confess\n",
    "that I can see nothing beautiful in this new beauty, who is as cold\n",
    "as the stone walls and floors she dreams of.  Rather would I have the\n",
    "love songs of romantic ages, rather Don Juan and Madame Venus, rather\n",
    "an elopement by ladder and rope on a moonlight night, followed by the\n",
    "father's curse, mother's moans, and the moral comments of neighbors,\n",
    "than correctness and propriety measured by yardsticks.  If love does\n",

    "in its artificial stiffness and its narrow respectabilities, which\n",

    "the fountain of life.  I once remarked that there seemed to be a\n",
    "deeper relationship between the old-fashioned mother and hostess,\n",
    "ever on the alert for the happiness of her little ones and the\n",
    "comfort of those she loved, and the truly new woman, than between\n",
    "the latter and her average emancipated sister.  The disciples of\n",
    "emancipation pure and simple declared me a heathen, fit only for the\n",
    "stake.  Their blind zeal did not let them see that my comparison\n",
    "between the old and the new was merely to prove that a goodly number\n",
    "of our grandmothers had more blood in their veins, far more humor and\n",

    "and simplicity, than the majority of our emancipated professional\n",

    "cut loose from the weight of prejudices, traditions, and customs.\n",
    "The demand for equal rights in every vocation of life is just and\n",
    "fair; but, after all, the most vital right is the right to love and\n",
    "be loved.  Indeed, if partial emancipation is to become a complete\n",
    "and true emancipation of woman, it will have to do away with the\n",
    "ridiculous notion that to be loved, to be sweetheart and mother, is\n",
    "synonymous with being slave or subordinate.  It will have to do away\n",
    "with the absurd notion of the dualism of the sexes, or that man and\n",

    "The popular notion about marriage and love is that they are\n",

    "Marriage and love have nothing in common; they are as far apart as\n",
    "the poles; are, in fact, antagonistic to each other.  No doubt some\n",
    "marriages have been the result of love.  Not, however, because love\n",
    "could assert itself only in marriage; much rather is it because few\n",
    "people can completely outgrow a convention.  There are today large\n",
    "numbers of men and women to whom marriage is naught but a farce, but\n",
    "who submit to it for the sake of public opinion.  At any rate, while\n",
    "it is true that some marriages are based on love, and while it is\n",
    "equally true that in some cases love continues in married life, I\n",

    "examination it will be found that it is a mere adjustment to the\n",

    "differs from the ordinary life insurance agreement only in that it is\n",
    "more binding, more exacting.  Its returns are insignificantly small\n",
    "compared with the investments.  In taking out an insurance policy one\n",
    "pays for it in dollars and cents, always at liberty to discontinue\n",
    "payments.  If, however, woman's premium is her husband, she pays for\n",
    "it with her name, her privacy, her self-respect, her very life,\n",
    "\"until death doth part.\"  Moreover, the marriage insurance condemns\n",
    "her to life-long dependency, to parasitism, to complete uselessness,\n",
    "individual as well as social.  Man, too, pays his toll, but as his\n",

    "towards that end.  Like the mute beast fattened for slaughter, she is\n",
    "prepared for that.  Yet, strange to say, she is allowed to know much\n",
    "less about her function as wife and mother than the ordinary artisan\n",
    "of his trade.  It is indecent and filthy for a respectable girl to\n",

    "field--sex.  Thus she enters into life-long relations with a man only\n",
    "to find herself shocked, repelled, outraged beyond measure by the\n",
    "most natural and healthy instinct, sex.  It is safe to say that a\n",
    "large percentage of the unhappiness, misery, distress, and physical\n",
