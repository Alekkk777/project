    "The Importance of Names\n",
    "\n",
    "  \"What's in a name?  That which we call a rose\n",
    "  By any other name would smell as sweet.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notwithstanding these lines, I maintain that the selection of names is\n",
    "important.  They should always be carefully chosen.  They are apt to\n",
    "influence friendships or to excite prejudices according to their\n",
    "significance.  We Chinese are very particular in this matter.  When a\n",
    "son is born the father or the grandfather chooses a name for the infant\n",
    "boy which, according to his horoscope, is likely to insure him success,\n",
    "or a name is selected which indicates the wish of the family for the\n",
    "new-born child.  Hence such names as \"happiness\", \"prosperity\",\n",
    "\"longevity\", \"success\", and others, with like propitious import, are\n",
    "common in China.  With regard to girls their names are generally\n",
    "selected from flowers, fruits, or trees.  Particular care is taken not\n",
    "to use a name which has a bad meaning.  In Washington I once met a man\n",
    "in an elevator whose name was \"Coffin\".  Was I to be blamed for\n",
    "wondering if the elevator would be my coffin?  On another occasion I\n",
    "met a man whose name was \"Death\", and as soon as I heard his name I\n",
    "felt inclined to run away, for I did not wish to die.  I am not\n",
    "superstitious.  I have frequently taken dinner with thirteen persons at\n",
    "the table, and I do not hesitate to start on a journey on a Friday.  I\n",
    "often do things which would not be done by superstitious persons in\n",
    "China.  But to meet a man calling himself \"Coffin\" or \"Death\" was too\n",
    "much for me, and with all my disbelief in superstition I could not help\n",
    "showing some repugnance to those who bore such names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equally important, if not more so, is the selection of a name for a\n",
    "state or a nation.  When the several states of America became\n",
    "independent they called themselves the \"United States of America\"--a\n",
    "very happy idea.  The Union was originally composed of thirteen states,\n",
    "covering about 300,000 square miles; it is now composed of forty-eight\n",
    "states and three territories, which in area amount to 3,571,492 square\n",
    "miles, practically as large in extent as China, the oldest nation in\n",
    "the world.  It should be noted that the name is most comprehensive:  it\n",
    "might comprise the entire continent of North and South America.  It is\n",
    "safe to say that the founders of the nation did not choose such a name\n",
    "without consideration, and doubtless the designation \"United States of\n",
    "America\" conceals a deep motive.  I once asked a gentleman who said he\n",
    "was an American whether he had come from South or North America, or\n",
    "whether he was a Mexican, a Peruvian or a native of any of the\n",
    "countries in Central America?  He replied with emphasis that he was an\n",
    "American citizen of the United States.  I said it might be the United\n",
    "States of Mexico, or Argentina, or other United States, but he answered\n",
    "that when he called himself a citizen it could not mean any other than\n",
    "that of the United States of America.  I have asked many other\n",
    "Americans similar questions and they all have given me replies in the\n",
    "same way.  We Chinese call our nation \"The Middle Kingdom\"; it was\n",
    "supposed to be in the center of the earth.  I give credit to the\n",
    "founders of the United States for a better knowledge of geography than\n",
    "that possessed by my countrymen of ancient times and do not assume that\n",
    "the newly formed nation was supposed to comprise the whole continent of\n",
    "North and South America, yet the name chosen is so comprehensive as to\n",
    "lead one naturally to suspect that it was intended to include the\n",
    "entire continent.  However, from my observation of their national\n",
    "conduct, I believe their purpose was just and humane; it was to set a\n",
    "noble example to the sister nations in the Western Hemisphere, and to\n",
    "knit more closely all the nations on that continent through the bonds\n",
    "of mutual justice, goodwill and friendship.  The American nation is,\n",
    "indeed, itself a pleasing and unique example of the principle of\n",
    "democracy.  Its government is ideal, with a liberal constitution, which\n",
    "in effect declares that all men are created equal, and that the\n",
    "government is \"of the people, for the people, and by the people.\"\n",
    "Anyone with ordinary intelligence and with open eyes, who should visit\n",
    "any city, town or village in America, could not but be impressed with\n",
    "the orderly and unostentatious way in which it is governed by the local\n",
    "authorities, or help being struck by the plain and democratic character\n",
    "of the people.  Even in the elementary schools, democracy is taught and\n",
    "practised.  I remember visiting a public school for children in\n",
    "Philadelphia, which I shall never forget.  There were about three or\n",
    "four hundred children, boys and girls, between seven and fourteen years\n",
    "of age.  They elected one of their students as mayor, another as judge,\n",
    "another as police commissioner, and in fact they elected for the\n",
    "control of their school community almost all the officials who usually\n",
    "govern a city.  There were a few Chinese children among the students,\n",
    "and one of them was pointed out to me as the police superintendent.\n",
    "This not only eloquently spoke of his popularity, but showed goodwill\n",
    "and harmony among the several hundred children, and the entire absence\n",
    "of race feeling.  The principals and teachers told me that they had no\n",
    "difficulty whatever with the students.  If one of them did anything\n",
    "wrong, which was not often, he would be taken by the student policeman\n",
    "before the judge, who would try the case, and decide it on its merits,\n",
    "and punish or discharge his fellow student as justice demanded.  I was\n",
    "assured by the school authorities that this system of self-government\n",
    "worked admirably; it not only relieved the teachers of the burden of\n",
    "constantly looking after the several hundred pupils, but each of them\n",
    "felt a moral responsibility to behave well, for the sake of preserving\n",
    "the peace and good name of the school.  Thus early imbued with the idea\n",
    "of self-government, and entrusted with the responsibilities of its\n",
    "administration, these children when grown up, take a deep interest in\n",
    "federal and municipal affairs, and, when elected for office, invariably\n",
    "perform their duties efficiently and with credit to themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "It cannot be disputed that the United States with its democratic system\n",
    "of government has exercised a great influence over the states and\n",
    "nations in Central and South America.  The following data showing the\n",
    "different nations of America, with the dates at which they turned their\n",
    "respective governments from Monarchies into Republics, all subsequent\n",
    "to the independence of the United States, are very significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mexico became a Republic in 1823, Honduras in 1839, Salvador in 1839,\n",
    "Nicaragua in 1821, Costa Rica in 1821, Panama in 1903, Colombia in\n",
    "1819, Venezuela in 1830, Ecuador in 1810, Brazil in 1889, Peru in 1821,\n",
    "Bolivia in 1825, Paraguay in 1811, Chile in 1810, Argentina in 1824,\n",
    "and Uruguay in 1828.\n",
    "\n",
    "These Republics have been closely modelled upon the republican form of\n",
    "government of the United States; thus, nearly all the nations or states\n",
    "on the continent of America have become Republics.  Canada still\n",
    "belongs to Great Britain.  The fair and generous policy pursued by the\n",
    "Imperial Government of Great Britain accounts for the Canadians'\n",
    "satisfaction with their political position, and for the fact that they\n",
    "do not wish a change.  It must be noted, however, that a section of the\n",
    "American people would like to see Canada incorporated with the United\n",
    "States.  I remember that at a public meeting held in Washington, at\n",
    "which Sir Wilfrid Laurier, then Premier of Canada, was present, an\n",
    "eminent judge of the Federal Supreme Court jocularly expressed a wish\n",
    "that Canada should be annexed to the United States.  Later, Mr. Champ\n",
    "Clark, a leader of the Democratic party in the House of\n",
    "Representatives, addressed the House urging the annexation of Canada.\n",
    "Even if these statements are not taken seriously they at least show the\n",
    "feelings of some people, and he would be a bold man who would prophesy\n",
    "the political status of Canada in the future.  There is, however, no\n",
    "present indication of any change being desired by the Canadians, and it\n",
    "may be safely presumed that the existing conditions will continue for\n",
    "many years to come.  This is not to be wondered at, for Canada though\n",
    "nominally a British colony practically enjoys almost all the privileges\n",
    "of an independent state.  She possesses a constitution similar to that\n",
    "of the United Kingdom, with a parliament of two houses, called the\n",
    "\"Senate\", and the \"House of Commons\".  The Sovereign of Great Britain\n",
    "appoints only the Governor General who acts in his name, but the\n",
    "Dominion is governed by a responsible Ministry, and all domestic\n",
    "affairs are managed by local officials, without interference from the\n",
    "Home Government.  Canadians enjoy as many rights as the inhabitants of\n",
    "England, with the additional advantage that they do not have to bear\n",
    "the burden of maintaining an army and navy.  Some years ago, if I\n",
    "remember rightly, in consequence of some agitation or discussion for\n",
    "independence, the late Lord Derby, then Secretary of State for the\n",
    "Colonies, stated that if the Canadians really wished for independence,\n",
    "the Home Government would not oppose, but that they should consider if\n",
    "they would gain anything by the change, seeing that they already had\n",
    "self-government, enjoyed all the benefits of a free people, and that\n",
    "the only right the Home Government reserved was the appointment of the\n",
    "Governor-General, although it assumed the responsibility of protecting\n",
    "every inch of their territory from encroachment.  Since this sensible\n",
    "advice from the Colonial Secretary, I have heard nothing more of the\n",
    "agitation for independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a commercial point of view, and for the welfare of the people,\n",
    "there is not much to choose to-day between a Limited Monarchy and a\n",
    "Republic.  Let us, for instance, compare England with the United\n",
    "States.  The people of England are as free and independent as the\n",
    "people of the United States, and though subjects, they enjoy as much\n",
    "freedom as Americans.  There are, however, some advantages in favor of\n",
    "a Republic.  Americans until recently paid their President a salary of\n",
    "only $50,000 a year; it is now $75,000 with an additional allowance of\n",
    "$25,000 for travelling expenses.  This is small indeed compared with\n",
    "the Civil List of the King or Emperor of any great nation.  There are\n",
    "more chances in a Republic for ambitious men to distinguish themselves;\n",
    "for instance, a citizen can become a president, and practically assume\n",
    "the functions of a king or an emperor.  In fact the President of the\n",
    "United States appoints his own cabinet officials, ambassadors,\n",
    "ministers, etc.  It is generally stated that every new president has\n",
    "the privilege of making more than ten thousand appointments.  With\n",
    "regard to the administration and executive functions he has in practice\n",
    "more power than is usually exercised by a king or an emperor of a\n",
    "Constitutional Monarchy.  On the other hand, in some matters, the\n",
    "executive of a Republic cannot do what a king or an emperor can do; for\n",
    "example, a president cannot declare war against a foreign nation\n",
    "without first obtaining the consent of Congress.  In a monarchical\n",
    "government the king or the cabinet officials assume enormous\n",
    "responsibilities.  Lord Beaconsfield (then Mr. D'Israeli), while he was\n",
    "Prime Minister of England, purchased in 1875 from the Khedive of Egypt\n",
    "176,602 Suez Canal shares for the sum of 3,976,582 Pounds on his own\n",
    "responsibility, and without consulting the Imperial Parliament.  When\n",
    "Parliament or Congress has to be consulted about everything, great\n",
    "national opportunities to do some profitable business must undoubtedly\n",
    "be sometimes lost.  No such bold national investment as that made by\n",
    "Lord Beaconsfield could have been undertaken by any American president\n",
    "on his own responsibility.  Mr. Cleveland, when president of the United\n",
    "States, said that \"the public affairs of the United States are\n",
    "transacted in a glass house.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Washington, in his farewell address, advised his compatriots that on\n",
    "account of the detached and distant situation of their country they\n",
    "should, in extending their commercial relations with foreign nations,\n",
    "have as little political connection with them as possible; and he asked\n",
    "this pertinent and pregnant question, \"Why, by interweaving our destiny\n",
    "with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in\n",
    "the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or\n",
    "caprice?\" In 1823, twenty-seven years after Washington's celebrated\n",
    "address, President Monroe in his annual message to Congress warned the\n",
    "European Powers not to plant any new colonies on any portion of the\n",
    "American hemisphere, as any attempt on their part to extend their\n",
    "system in that part of the world would be considered as dangerous to\n",
    "the peace and safety of the United States.  This \"Monroe Doctrine\", as\n",
    "it has since been called, practically protects every state and country\n",
    "on the American continent from attack or interference by any foreign\n",
    "power, and it cannot be denied that it has been and is now the chief\n",
    "factor in preserving the integrity of all the countries on that\n",
    "continent.  Thus the United States is assuming the role of guardian\n",
    "over the other American nations.  In the city of Washington there is an\n",
    "International Bureau of the American Republics, in which all the\n",
    "Republics of Central and South America are represented.  It is housed\n",
    "in a magnificent palace made possible by the beneficence of Mr. Andrew\n",
    "Carnegie, the American multi-millionaire and philanthropist, and the\n",
    "contributions of the different governments.  It cost 750,000 gold\n",
    "dollars, and Mr. John Barrett, the capable and popular director of the\n",
    "Bureau, has well called it \"a temple of friendship and commerce and a\n",
    "meeting place for the American Republics.\"  The Bureau is supported by\n",
    "the joint contributions of the twenty-one American Republics, and its\n",
    "affairs are controlled by a governing board composed of their\n",
    "diplomatic representatives in Washington, with the American Secretary\n",
    "of State as chairman ex officio.  This institution no doubt strengthens\n",
    "the position of the United States and is calculated to draw the\n",
    "American Republics into closer friendship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 2.  American Prosperity\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main causes of the prosperity of the great American Republic\n",
    "is its natural resources.  It possesses coal, oil, silver, gold,\n",
    "copper, and all the other mineral ores.  Nature seems, indeed, to have\n",
    "provided almost everything that man needs.  The soil is rich; wheat and\n",
    "every kind of fruit can be grown; but favorable as are these native\n",
    "conditions they could not be turned to any great advantage without the\n",
    "skill and industry of enterprising men.  Many countries in Africa and\n",
    "Asia possess equal advantages, but they are not equally prosperous.\n",
    "This leads me to the consideration of another reason for America's\n",
    "growth.  The men who have migrated to the United States have not been\n",
    "rich people.  They went there to make a living.  They were prepared to\n",
    "work, their purpose was to improve their condition, and they were\n",
    "willing to undertake any manual or mental labor to accomplish their\n",
    "object.  They were hardy and strong and could bear a heavy strain.\n",
    "Their children inherited their good qualities, and so an American is\n",
    "generally more hard working and enterprising than most of the people in\n",
    "Europe and elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason for America's success is the great freedom which each\n",
    "citizen enjoys.  Every man considers himself the equal of every other,\n",
    "and a young man who is ambitious will not rest until he reaches the top\n",
    "of his profession or trade.  Thousands of Americans who were once very\n",
    "poor, have become millionaires or multi-millionaires.  Many of them had\n",
    "no college education, they taught themselves, and some of them have\n",
    "become both literary and scholarly.  A college or university education\n",
    "does not necessarily make a man learned; it only gives him the\n",
    "opportunity to learn.  It is said that some college men have proven\n",
    "themselves to be quite ignorant, or rather that they do not know so\n",
    "much as those who have been self-taught.  I do not in any way wish to\n",
    "disparage a college education; no doubt men who have been trained in a\n",
    "university start in life with better prospects and with a greater\n",
    "chance of success, but those men who have not had such advantages have\n",
    "doubtless done much to make their country great and prosperous, and\n",
    "they ought to be recognized as great men.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general desire of the American people to travel abroad is one of\n",
    "their good traits.  People who never leave their homes cannot know\n",
    "much.  A person may become well-informed by reading, but his practical\n",
    "knowledge cannot be compared with that of a person who has travelled.\n",
    "We Chinese are great sinners in this regard.  A Chinese maxim says, \"It\n",
    "is dangerous to ride on horseback or to go on a voyage\":  hence until\n",
    "very recently we had a horror of going abroad.  A person who remains\n",
    "all his life in his own town is generally narrow-minded,\n",
    "self-opinioned, and selfish.  The American people are free from these\n",
    "faults.  It is not only the rich and the well-to-do who visit foreign\n",
    "countries, but tradesmen and workmen when they have saved a little\n",
    "money also often cross the Atlantic.  Some years ago a Senator in\n",
    "Washington told me that he crossed the Atlantic Ocean every summer and\n",
    "spent several months in Europe, and that the next trip would be his\n",
    "twenty-eighth voyage.  I found, however, that he had never gone beyond\n",
    "Europe.  I ventured to suggest that he should extend his next annual\n",
    "journey a little farther and visit Japan, China, and other places in\n",
    "the Far East which I felt sure he would find both interesting and\n",
    "instructive.  I have travelled through many countries in Europe and\n",
    "South America, and wherever I have gone and at whatever hotel I have\n",
    "put up, I have always found some Americans, and on many occasions I\n",
    "have met friends and acquaintances whom I had known in Washington or\n",
    "New York.  But it is not only the men who go abroad; in many cases\n",
    "ladies also travel by themselves.  On several occasions lady friends\n",
    "from Washington, Philadelphia, and New York have visited me in Peking.\n",
    "This is one of the Americans' strong points.  Is it not wiser and much\n",
    "more useful to disburse a few hundred dollars or so in travelling and\n",
    "gaining knowledge, coming in contact with other peoples and enlarging\n",
    "the mind, than to spend large sums of money in gaudy dresses, precious\n",
    "stones, trinkets, and other luxuries?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a large country like America where a considerable portion of the\n",
    "land still remains practically uncultivated or undeveloped, hardy,\n",
    "industrious, and patient workmen are a necessity.  But the almost\n",
    "unchecked influx of immigrants who are not desirable citizens cannot\n",
    "but harm the country.  In these days of international trade it is right\n",
    "that ingress and egress from one country to another should be\n",
    "unhampered, but persons who have committed crimes at home, or who are\n",
    "ignorant and illiterate, cannot become desirable citizens anywhere.\n",
    "They should be barred out of the United States of America.  It is well\n",
    "known that foreigners take part in the municipal and federal affairs of\n",
    "the country as soon as they become citizens.  Now if such persons\n",
    "really worked for the good of their adopted country, there could be no\n",
    "objection to this, but it is no secret that many have no such motives.\n",
    "That being so, it is a question whether steps should not be taken to\n",
    "limit their freedom.  On the other hand, as many farms suffer from lack\n",
    "of workmen, people from whatever country who are industrious, patient,\n",
    "and persevering ought to be admitted as laborers.  They would be a\n",
    "great boon to the nation.  The fear of competition by cheap labor is\n",
    "causeless; regulations might be drawn up for the control of these\n",
    "foreign laborers, and on their arrival they could be drafted to those\n",
    "places where their services might be most urgently needed.  So long as\n",
    "honest and steady workmen are excluded for no reason other than that\n",
    "they are Asiatics, while white men are indiscriminately admitted, I\n",
    "fear that the prosperity of the country cannot be considered permanent,\n",
    "for agriculture is the backbone of stable wealth.  Yet at present it is\n",
    "the country's wealth which is one of the important factors of America's\n",
    "greatness.  In the United States there are thousands of individuals\n",
    "whose fortunes are counted by seven or eight figures in gold dollars.\n",
    "And much of this money has been used to build railways, or to develop\n",
    "manufactories and other useful industries.  The country has grown great\n",
    "through useful work, and not on account of the army and navy.  In 1881\n",
    "America's army numbered only 26,622 men, and her navy consisted of only\n",
    "24 iron-clads, 2 torpedo-boats, and 25 tugs, but in 1910 the peace\n",
    "strength of her army was 96,628 and the navy boasted 33 battleships and\n",
    "120 armored cruisers of different sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the last few years it has been the policy of many nations to\n",
    "increase the army and to build as many Dreadnaughts and\n",
    "super-dreadnaughts as possible.  Many statesmen have been infected by\n",
    "this Dreadnaught fever.  Their policy seems to be based on the idea\n",
    "that the safety of a nation depends on the number of its battleships.\n",
    "Even peaceful and moderate men are carried away by this hobby, and\n",
    "support it.  It is forgotten that great changes have taken place during\n",
    "the last twenty or thirty years; that a nation can now be attacked by\n",
    "means quite beyond the reach of Dreadnaughts.  The enormous sums spent\n",
    "on these frightful monsters, if applied to more worthy objects, would\n",
    "have a greater effect in preserving the nations' heritages than\n",
    "anything these monstrosities can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nation which has a large army and a strong navy may be called\n",
    "powerful, but it cannot be considered great without other good\n",
    "requisites.  I consider a nation as great when she is peacefully,\n",
    "justly, and humanely governed, and when she possesses a large number of\n",
    "benevolent and good men who have a voice in the administration.  The\n",
    "greater the number of good men that a nation possesses the greater she\n",
    "becomes.  America is known to have a large number of such men and\n",
    "women, men and women who devote their time and money to preaching peace\n",
    "among the nations.  Mr. Andrew Carnegie is worth a hundred\n",
    "Dreadnaughts.  He and others like him are the chief factors in\n",
    "safeguarding the interests and welfare of America.  The territory of\n",
    "the United States is separated from Europe and other countries by vast\n",
    "oceans; so that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for a foe to\n",
    "successfully attack any portion of that country.  But who wishes to\n",
    "attack her?  She has scarcely an enemy.  No country is invaded by\n",
    "another without cause, and as the United States is in friendly\n",
    "relations with all the Powers, there is no reason to fear foreign\n",
    "invasion.  Even should a foreign power successfully attack her and\n",
    "usurp a portion of her territories, a supposition which is most\n",
    "improbable, would the enemy be able to hold what he seized?  History\n",
    "shows that no conquered country has ever been successfully and\n",
    "permanently kept without the people's consent, and there is not the\n",
    "least chance that the Americans will ever consent to the rule of a\n",
    "foreign government.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is to be hoped that the United States will not follow the example of\n",
    "other nations and unduly increase her armaments, but that she will take\n",
    "the lead in the universal peace movement and show the world that a\n",
    "great power can exist and maintain her position without force of arms.\n",
    "I am aware that general disarmament is not popular among statesmen,\n",
    "that it has been denounced by an eminent authority as a \"will-o'-the\n",
    "wisp\", that arbitration has been styled a \"Jack-o'-lantern\", but this\n",
    "is not the first time a good and workable scheme has been branded with\n",
    "opprobrious names.  The abolition of slavery was at one time considered\n",
    "to be an insane man's dream; now all people believe in it.  Will the\n",
    "twentieth century witness the collapse of our present civilization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are the world's armaments constantly increasing?  To my mind it is\n",
    "due to two causes, one of which is mistrust.  One nation begins to\n",
    "build Dreadnaughts, another does the same through fear and mistrust.\n",
    "The second cause is that it is the fashion of some nations to follow\n",
    "the example of others that they may preserve their position as great\n",
    "naval powers.  But it is unnecessary for the United States to show such\n",
    "mistrust or to follow such fashion.  She should rather, as becomes a\n",
    "great and powerful nation, take an independent course of her own.  If\n",
    "she sets the example other nations in due time will follow her.  The\n",
    "peace of the world will be more surely guarded, and America will win\n",
    "the approbation, the respect, and the gratitude of all peace-loving\n",
    "people.\n",
    "It would seem reasonable to expect that in yielding so fully to the\n",
    "wishes of the United States in this second negotiation the Chinese\n",
    "Government would not be called upon to make any further concessions in\n",
    "the interests or at the demand of the labor unions on the Pacific\n",
    "coast, but in this China was disappointed.  Within a period of less\n",
    "than ten years an urgent application was made by the American Secretary\n",
    "of State for a new treaty amended so as to enable the Congress of the\n",
    "United States to still further restrict the privileges of Chinese\n",
    "laborers who had come to the United States.  And when the Chinese\n",
    "Government hesitated to consent to the withdrawal of rights which the\n",
    "United States granted to the subjects of other Governments, Congress\n",
    "passed the Scott Act of 1888 prohibiting any Chinese person from\n",
    "entering the United States except Chinese officials, teachers,\n",
    "students, merchants or travellers for pleasure or curiosity and\n",
    "forbidding also Chinese laborers in the United States, after having\n",
    "left, from returning thereto.  This, in the words of Hon. J. W. Foster,\n",
    "ex-Secretary of State and a distinguished international lawyer, \"was a\n",
    "deliberate violation of the Treaty of 1880 and was so declared by the\n",
    "Supreme Court of the United States.\"  In order to save the Executive of\n",
    "the United States from embarrassment, the Chinese Government, contrary\n",
    "to its own sense of justice, and of international comity, for a third\n",
    "time yielded to the wishes of the United States, and concluded the\n",
    "amended treaty of 1894 which gave Congress additional power of\n",
    "legislation respecting Chinese laborers.  By Article I of this treaty\n",
    "it was agreed that for a term of ten years the coming of Chinese\n",
    "laborers to the United States should be absolutely prohibited.  Article\n",
    "III distinctly provided that \"the provisions of this convention shall\n",
    "not affect the right at present enjoyed of Chinese subjects, being\n",
    "officials, teachers, students, merchants, or travellers for curiosity\n",
    "or pleasure, but not laborers, of coming to the United States and\n",
    "residing therein.\" Thus it is clear that the prohibition affects only\n",
    "laborers, and not the other classes of Chinese.  For a few years after\n",
    "the signing of this convention this was the view adopted and acted upon\n",
    "by the immigration officials, but afterward they changed their\n",
    "attitude, and the foregoing Article has since been interpreted to mean\n",
    "that only the above-mentioned five classes can be admitted into the\n",
    "United States, and that all the other classes of Chinese, however\n",
    "respectable and honorable, must be refused admission.  Will my readers\n",
    "believe that a Chinese banker, physician, lawyer, broker, commercial\n",
    "agent, scholar or professor could all be barred out of the United\n",
    "States of America under the provisions of this convention?  In the face\n",
    "of the plain language of the text it seems too absurd and unreasonable\n",
    "to be contemplated, and yet it is a fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "This convention was proclaimed in December, 1894.  According to its\n",
    "provisions, it was to remain in force only for a period of ten years,\n",
    "but that if six months before the end of that period neither Power\n",
    "should give notice of denunciation it should be extended for a similar\n",
    "period.  Such notice was, however, given by China to the United States\n",
    "and accordingly the convention expired in December, 1904, and is now no\n",
    "longer in force.  No serious attempt has since been made by the United\n",
    "States Government to negotiate a new treaty regarding Chinese laborers,\n",
    "so the customs and immigration officials continue to prohibit Chinese\n",
    "laborers from coming to America by virtue of the law passed by\n",
    "Congress.  It will be seen that by the treaty of 1868, known as the\n",
    "\"Burlingame Treaty\", the United States Government formally agreed that\n",
    "Chinese subjects, visiting or residing in the United States, should\n",
    "enjoy the same privileges and immunities as were enjoyed by the\n",
    "citizens or subjects of the most favored nation; that being so, and as\n",
    "the convention of 1894 has expired, according to the legal opinion of\n",
    "Mr. John W. Foster, and other eminent lawyers, the continuation of the\n",
    "exclusion of Chinese laborers and the restrictions placed upon Chinese\n",
    "merchants and others seeking admission to the United States are not\n",
    "only without international authority but in violation of treaty\n",
    "stipulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enforcement of the exclusion laws against Chinese in the Hawaiian\n",
    "and Philippine Islands is still more inexcusable.  The complaint in\n",
    "America against the immigration of Chinese laborers was that such\n",
    "immigration was detrimental to white labor, but in those Islands there\n",
    "has been no such complaint; on the contrary the enforcement of the law\n",
    "against the Chinese in Hawaii has been, and is, contrary to the\n",
    "unanimous wish of the local Government and the people.  Free\n",
    "intercourse and immigration between those Islands and China have been\n",
    "maintained for centuries.  What is most objectionable and unfair is\n",
    "that the Chinese should be singled out for discrimination, while all\n",
    "other Asiatics such as Japanese, Siamese, and Malays are allowed to\n",
    "enter America and her colonies without restraint.  It is my belief that\n",
    "the gross injustice that has been inflicted upon the Chinese people by\n",
    "the harsh working of the exclusion law is not known to the large\n",
    "majority of the American people, for I am sure they would not allow the\n",
    "continuation of such hardships to be suffered by those who are their\n",
    "sincere friends.  China does not wish special treatment, she only asks\n",
    "that her people shall be treated in the same way as the citizens or\n",
    "subjects of other countries.  Will the great American nation still\n",
    "refuse to consent to this?\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem of immigration in a manner that would be\n",
    "satisfactory to all parties is not an easy task, as so many conflicting\n",
    "interests are involved.  But it is not impossible.  If persons\n",
    "interested in this question be really desirous of seeing it settled and\n",
    "are willing to listen to reasonable proposals, I believe that a way may\n",
    "be found for its solution.  There is good reason for my optimistic\n",
    "opinion.  Even the Labor Unions, unless I am mistaken, would welcome an\n",
    "amicable settlement of this complicated question.  In 1902, while at\n",
    "Washington, I was agreeably surprised to receive a deputation of the\n",
    "leaders of the Central Labor Union of Binghamton, New York, inviting me\n",
    "to pay a visit there and to deliver an address.  As I did not wish to\n",
    "disappoint them I accepted their invitation.  During my short stay\n",
    "there, I was very cordially and warmly received, and most kindly\n",
    "treated not only by the local authorities and inhabitants, but by the\n",
    "members of the Labor Union and the working men also.  I found that the\n",
    "Union leaders and the working men were most reasonable, their platform\n",
    "being, as far as I could learn, to have no cheap labor competition but\n",
    "not necessarily discrimination against any race.  If the United States\n",
    "Government would appoint a commission composed of members representing\n",
    "the Labor Unions, manufacturers and merchants, to treat with a similar\n",
    "commission nominated by the Chinese Government, the whole question in\n",
    "all its bearings could be discussed, and I feel certain that after free\n",
    "and candid exchange of views, the joint Commissioners would be able to\n",
    "arrive at a scheme which would put at rest once for all the conflicting\n",
    "claims, and settle the matter satisfactorily to both China and the\n",
    "United States.\n",
