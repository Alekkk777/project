WHAT WE HAVE TO DO
You are a researcher in a hospital lab and are given the task to develop a learning model that supports doctors with diagnosing illnesses that affect patients’ lungs. At your disposal, you have a set X-ray lung scans with examples of patients who had either pneumonia, Covid-19, or no illness. Using the Keras module, you will create a classification model that outputs a diagnosis based on a patient’s X-ray scan. You hope this model can help doctors with the challenge of deciphering X-ray scans and open a dialogue between your research team and the medical staff to create learning models that are as effective and interpretable as possible.
